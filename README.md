# Advanced Programming 2024

Welcome to the course website for Advanced Programming (AP) 2024! All
material and general information will be provided here. Announcements,
assignment handin, and the discussion forum remains on Absalon. While
this website is a Git repository, you are not required or expected to
use Git to interact with it, but feel free to do so if convenient for
you.

The programming languages we will be using are **Haskell** and
**Erlang**.

The website and course is currently under construction, and all
information is still tentative.

## Preparation

AP has a reputation as a difficult course, particularly for
inexperienced programmers, and *especially* if you do not have prior
experience with functional programming. If you worry that your
background is insufficient, we recommend spending a little time
(re-)familiarising yourself with functional programming. The specific
language and book does not matter, but since we will use Haskell in
AP, you might as well read [Programming in
Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton.
If you do not like the style of this book, there are plenty others
available (such as [Haskell from First
Principles](https://haskellbook.com/)).

Many Haskell books focus on industrial uses, and go into great detail
about how to use complex libraries and such. This is well and good for
real-world programming, but unnecessary for AP, where we take a more
narrow focus. You do not need to read a thick book, unless you want
to.

## Textbooks

We do not mandate specific textbooks for learning programming
languages, but we do have suggestions. We will also specify some
research papers and course notes as mandated or suggested reading.

### Haskell

* [Programming in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)
* [Course notes from Brent Yorgey's UPenn Haskell course](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html)

### Erlang

* [Erlang and OTP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/erlang-and-otp-in-action)

## Course structure

The course consists of two lectures and two exercise classes every
week. The lectures are on Tuesday 10:00-12:00 and Thursday
13:00-15:00. The exercise classes are both on Thursday, at 10:00-12:00
and 15:00-17:00 respectively.

Locations are TBD.
