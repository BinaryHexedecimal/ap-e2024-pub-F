# Week 1 - Programming in Haskell

In this week we will look at the basics of Haskell programming,
including type classes. While we do have to spend some time on the
minutiae of syntax and basic definitions, our true goal is to start on
acquiring an understanding of how to structure programs along abstract
and principled lines. Type classes are the most explicit example of
this idea.

## Slides and material

TBA

## Suggested Reading

* Part 1 of *Programming in Haskell*. Most of this is standard
  functional programming material, so feel free to skim those parts.
  The most interesting chapter is chapter 8.

## Exercises

The mandatory assignment builds directly on the concepts *and code*
developed during the exercises. You are strongly adviced to complete
the exercises before embarking on the assignment. It may also be a
useful exercise to do other exercises (unrelated to the assignment),
for example the ones in *Programming in Haskell*.
