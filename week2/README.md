# Week 2 - Monads

This week we will begin studying monadic programming in Haskell. This
topic is foundational to the remainder of the course.

## Slides and Material

## TBA

## Suggested Reading

* Philip Wadler's [The Essence of Functional Programming](essence-of-functional-programming.pdf).

* Chapter 12 in *Programming in Haskell*.

* [All About Monads](https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads)

## Exercises

In these exercises you will construct an interpreter that is similar
in functionality to the one developed in week 1. However, this time we
will implement the interpreter via an evaluation monad that abstracts
away book-keeping of environments and failures. The second mandatory
assignment will ask you to extend this monadic interpreter.

Your starting point is found in [handout/](handout/) and complete
solutions are in [solutions/](solutions/). For some of the tasks,
partial or complete solutions are also included inline below. In terms
of modules, the structure is identical to week 1.
